example-ofxOpenNI
=================

This example uses ofxOpenNI through the ofxBase3DVideo interface. 
The interface is currently not supported by the ofxOpenNI addon by Matthew Gingold (https://github.com/gameoverhack/ofxOpenNI). 
ofxReprojection offers an adapter class, ofxOpeNNIBase3DVideoAdapter, which handles this interface.


Alternatively, a fork with ofxBase3DVideo included in ofxOpenNI can be found here: https://github.com/luteberget/ofxOpenNI/tree/develop
