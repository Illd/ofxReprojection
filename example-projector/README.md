ofxReprojection: example-projector
==================================

Minimal example demonstrating use of the class ofxProjector to draw 
onto a projector (secondary monitor) in a separate, fullscreen window.

You should see a window on your main (primary) monitor saying "main window", and
a fullscreen window should pop up on your projector, saying "projector window".

Requires use of ofAppGLFWWindow as OpenGL/windowing manager in openFrameworks.
